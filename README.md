# Driver_Distraction_Detection
Individual project - using computer vision to detect distracted driver states
# Synopsis
Using Python and Tensorflow, I implemented an image classifier model that detects various distracted driver states. I made use of computer vision to create a model with an accuracy of 80+% to detect distracted drivers by uploading images, using a dataset for the model. I also visualized the data through various means and analyzed it by matrices and graphs on various stages of the model. The VGG16 architecture was used for the same, although I did try Resnet, DenseNet, and VGG19 with similar accuracies.
